Traffic management system is a cornerstone of a Smart city. In the current problems of the world, urban mobility is one of the major problems, especially in metropolitan cities. Previous traffic management systems are not capable enough to tackle this growth of traffic on the road networks. The purpose of this paper is to propose a smart traffic management system using the Internet of Things and a decentralized approach to optimize traffic on the roads to manage all traffic situations more accurately. 
This proposed system is overcoming the flaws of previous traffic management systems. The system takes traffic density as input from ultrasonic sensors, resultantly giving output as signals management into a database. An algorithm is used to predicts the traffic density for future to minimize the traffic congestion. Besides this, our device to control the traffic light are also used to prioritize the emergency vehicles like ambulance, fire brigade etc. by implementing our device in such vehicles. In the case of emergency situations, such as fire explosion or burning of something, the emergency vehicle can reach to the destination in the most minimum time. 
Moreover, an email is sent to the emergency vehicle to determine which is the best route to take to reach to their destination in the most minimum time. An algorithm is used to calculate the route. In addition, the native user can see future traffic condition at a particular node. The proposed system is validated by constructing a prototype and deploying it in a city of Penang. A web application is also there to provide useful information in graphical formats to the higher authorities of the smart city which is fruitful in future road planning.
